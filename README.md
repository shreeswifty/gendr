So many kind folks on https://llllllll.co/
gendr: is an learning tool kindy offered by ezra buchla so i could grasp the SuperCollider to Norns system process & have some fun Xenakis stuff to do it with. 

Nick Collins got me excited about Iannis many years ago and i can say with all confidence this is a fun interactive way 
to get into a little lua, some UI/UX planning and of course SuperCollider, linux and boutique instruments whilst preserving that sound.
